# Sync NoSQL Data With PouchDB, AngularJS.

This is a sample project to demonstrate how you can use AngularJS and PouchDB in a way that plays nice with electron. This version of code can go into a "public" folder, and then you can include it with electron to get it running properly.

This original code was from a blog post tutorial on CouchBase.

## Instructions

Download the latest master branch commit as well as the latest version of the Couchbase Sync Gateway.  From your Terminal or Command Prompt, with the project as your current working directory, run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```

You can now test the application by visiting **http://localhost:9000** from your web browser.
